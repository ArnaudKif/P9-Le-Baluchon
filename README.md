# P9_Le_Baluchon

This project is part of course #9 of the OpenClassRooms formation iOS Developer.

It focuses on two important elements:
 
- service calls (REST)
- navigation components.

Description of the application:

The Baluchon is a three page application:
- In the exchange rate page, one can insert an amount in your local currency and see the result in dollars ($).
- In the translation page, the user can write the sentence of his choice in French and get its translation in English.
- In the weather page, you will see the weather information of New York and the city of your choice.

Bonus: 

Adding a bonus is mandatory. Here are the ones I have developed: 
- Choice of the city for the weather
- Choice of the translation language
- Choice of the conversion currency

-- WARNING --

    let googleApiIdKey = "YourGoogleAPIIdKey"
    let dataFixerApiIdKey = " YourFixerAPIIdKey"
